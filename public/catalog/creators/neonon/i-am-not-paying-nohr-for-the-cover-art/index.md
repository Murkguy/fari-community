# I am not paying Nohr for the cover art

The #6 best public domain art scavenging guide.

## READ this before YOU begin carefully

1.  Read about the copyright laws in your country. Yes, it's boring, but it will save you trouble later, and it doesn't matter whether you plan on releasing something commercially or not. JUST DO IT. In most cases artwork enters the Public Domain 50/70/100 years after the death of the author (not the art creation date). The amount of time you need to wait depends on your local laws.
2.  When browsing the more legitimate websites, always look for the Public Domain symbol (on the left) or other Licencing information. Sometimes, even if the dates are OK, an organisation can hold copyright and disallow use of the artwork without a permission, fee, or both. I had a case where the copyright holder I reached out to declined my request to use their painting for a TRPG cover photobash.
3.  Photos showing modern brands, logos, buildings, painting, sculptures, etc. - even those available on the Public Domain websites, cannot be used commercially without consent from the copyright owners of the things portrayed in those pictures. I had a case like that where a contemporary artist, whose work got captured on a photo, declined my request to use that photo in a TRPG spread.
4.  While a painting or a sculpture might be in the Public Domain, if someone takes a photo of them, that photo has its own copyright and requires consent from the photographer to be used.
5.  If an image or photo looks too good to be true, it's usually not really in the Public Domain, or was (TRIGGER WARNING) generated by an AI and slightly altered. A good rule of thumb is this - if the artwork looks modern, and there is no clear information anywhere about the artist's intent to publish it for free, it's probably a no-go. confirm whether an image is legit.
6.  When browsing foreign websites, try using keywords in the native language in addition to English for potential additional results (e.g., Rijksmuseum is in the Netherlands, so try using Netherlandish).
7.  If a website is not listed in a certain category (e.g. Photos), it doesn't necessarily mean it has zero content of that type, but the amount of content or its quality might be too low to mention.
8.  If a website is listed in multiple categories, the Pros, Cons, and Workflow Notes might differ across these (e.g. there's an extra step to find sculptures on Obelisk, while paintings are easily available).
9.  If you can and have enough layout space to do this, list the authors and titles of images, photos, and paintings you use in your projects. If they're alive it might give them some additional exposure. you. Skip this advice if you're REALLY cool.
