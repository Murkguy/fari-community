# The World of The Murk

## Introduction

The world, once vibrant and full of promise, now stands on the precipice of failure and decay. It is a gradual decline that may span centuries, but the eventual outcome seems inevitable: humanity, without some extraordinary salvation, will wither away, fading into oblivion, leaving behind nothing but a distant memory.

Amidst this impending catastrophe, the Princes and their Councils are not oblivious to the looming doom. Some among them tirelessly dedicate their efforts towards salvaging whatever remnants of hope and prosperity they can for their people. These noble souls toil day and night, driven by a desperate desire to stave off the encroaching darkness. However, not all are burdened by such noble intentions; there are those who indulge in reckless hedonism, engaging in lavish feasts and orgies, seeking fleeting pleasures as a means to distract themselves from the grim reality that surrounds them.

In the face of uncertainty and despair, the once-grand Cathedrals have become sanctuaries overflowing with desperate parishioners. Their anguished voices rise in fervent supplication, beseeching their deities for deliverance from the impending doom. Some gods answer their pleas, offering solace and guidance in these trying times, while others remain ominously silent, their intentions and existence questioned by the disillusioned masses. The distinction between divine intervention and divine indifference has blurred, leaving the faithful in a state of confusion and doubt.

Meanwhile, the towering Spires of the High Magisters buzz with ceaseless activity. These learned scholars and wielders of great magical power devote themselves tirelessly to preserve what shreds of humanity's legacy remain. Consumed by guilt for their perceived role in bringing about this calamitous state of affairs, they bear the weight of their hubris as the ultimate sin of mankind. Their tireless efforts serve as a testament to the depths of their remorse and the earnest desire to rectify the grave mistakes that have led to this precipice of destruction.

However, amidst the struggles of the ruling elite, the common folk find themselves caught in a downward spiral of worsening circumstances. The ravages of war have left scars that are not easily healed, as their sons and daughters were sent off to battle, compelled by duty and loyalty to defend their homeland. These brave souls returned forever changed, their spirits weighed down by the atrocities they witnessed and the deeds they were forced to commit. Gazing upon their own children, born into a world defined by chaos and suffering, they lament the loss of innocence and wonder what might have been in a world untouched by the horrors they have endured.

Such is the backdrop against which the tale of The Murk unfolds—a haunting narrative that chronicles the fate of those who have survived a world that has been reduced to ruins. It is a world that has witnessed the pinnacle of human achievement, only to descend into the abyss of despair and desolation.

The promise of a brave new world, envisioned by those who dedicated centuries of arduous work, relentless study, ceaseless effort, and unyielding progress, now seems like a cruel mockery of their endeavors. A priest of Le Vides, speaking in the year 5 After The Black Day, encapsulates the collective disillusionment: "How can this ruin be the reward for such pursuit?" The Vardan Empire, once a formidable bastion of power and unity, now stands fractured and fragmented. The central authority of the emperor, the might of his legions, and the sanctity of his laws have all faded into the annals of memory, mere vestiges of a bygone era.

In the wake of the empire's disintegration, the various principalities vie for supremacy, engaging in bitter power struggles among themselves, yet momentarily uniting only in the face of existential threats that threaten their very existence
.
Beyond their borders, the enigmatic Far Lands, watching with unknowing intent, bide their time, sharpening their knives, and gradually encroaching upon the weakened territories, waiting for the opportune moment to strike the final blow. The common populace, caught in the ebb and flow of political turmoil, suffers as the centralization of power diminishes, leading to the concentration of education and resources in the hands of a privileged few, further exacerbating the stagnation and inequality that plague the land.

Amidst this desolation, a glimmer of hope once shone through the industrialization of magic—an innovation that brought a flicker of light to the beleaguered Empire. The fusion of Esoteria, the mystical arts, with assembly techniques created a revolutionary capacity to sustain, shelter, and arm a large population within the confines of relatively small territories. This newfound growth in production served as a boon for over a century, rekindling a sense of optimism and rejuvenation within the old Empire. Many anticipated that this resurgence would pave the way for a grand unification, a harmonious gathering of all former subjects under a banner of collective prosperity.

However, instead of achieving the long-awaited unity, this industrialized magic inadvertently became a bane, a catalyst that crippled the region. The Great War erupted, waged relentlessly between the bickering principalities and the encroaching Far Lands, their alliances in a constant state of flux. The heartland of the Vardan lands became the epicenter of this devastating conflict. Then, in an event shrouded in mystery, known simply as "The The Black Day," the Vardan homeland succumbed to an unimaginable magical catastrophe of cataclysmic proportions.

The details of the event remain cloaked in uncertainty, the truth obscured by the swirling fog of history. No one can definitively say what transpired or who was responsible for the The Black Day that befell the battle-scarred land. However, the Battle of Doria, a pivotal moment in the war, ended in eerie silence, followed by a cataclysmic explosion. From the aftermath of this detonation emerged a sinister sea of black fog, stretching for miles into the sky, mercilessly swallowing all life within its malevolent embrace. Thus, "The Murk" was born, an ominous testament to the irreversible destruction that had befallen the Vardan homeland.

Today, the Murk stands as a hauntingly silent gateway into the heart of the old Empire—a chilling reminder of the tragedies that have unfolded. While the principalities slowly begin to recover from the devastation, the deep-seated grudges and animosities of the past three decades have not been extinguished; they merely lie dormant, waiting for the opportune moment to resurface and ignite once again.

In the face of impending doom and the shattered remnants of a once-great civilization, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Will humanity find the strength and resilience to rise above the ashes and forge a new future, or will they succumb to the inexorable forces of decay and be consigned to the annals of forgotten history? Only time will tell as the tale of The Murk continues to unfold, chronicling the journey of those who dare to navigate the treacherous path that lies ahead.

## Lands of Tellus

While Tellus's wonders span far and wide, this supplement zeroes in on the heart of the central continent, particularly within the former territories of the illustrious Vardan Empire and the surrounding nations. While our focus is primarily on the former Empire’s peoples and their lands, it is crucial to note that this supplement does not claim to be an exhaustive compendium of all the peoples and territories that exist within the vast reaches of Tellus.

### Doria: The Legacy of Varranthal

![The Remnants of Doria](https://gyazo.com/ba68b0b6ad582ebb51c99795ac344d22)

Set deep within the heart of the old Vardan Empire, the lands that would later become the country of Doria hold an illustrious history. This region served as the birthplace of the original sixteen emperors, a testament to its significance as the pinnacle of power on all of Tellus. Indeed, the entirety of Doria was intricately intertwined with the legacy of the Vardan Empire, sharing not only its territories but also a capital city that remained unchanged—Varranthal.

The zenith of Doria's influence and supremacy began to wane following the ascension of Emperor Regieran to the realm beyond in 1331 BBD. In the wake of his departure, the empire descended into a tumultuous era of internal strife, characterized by intense power struggles and a revolving door of rulers.

Yet, amid the political turmoil, Doria experienced a resurgence under the reign of King Arminus Magnus, who ascended the throne in 745 BBD. With remarkable acumen, Arminus Magnus consolidated the fragmented political and military landscape, ushering in a new golden era for Doria. During this transformative period, the nation reclaimed much of its former homeland, reestablishing control over conquered territories and asserting dominance over neighboring regions. The conquest even extended southward, as Doria ventured into Kemet, subjugating the land while maintaining a puppet ruler in place. Although the empire did not retain the cohesion of its earlier days, Doria's influence reigned supreme for nearly 1600 years.

However, the tides of fate took an irreversible turn with the advent of The Black Day in 0 AC. As the catastrophic event unfolded, Doria found itself at the epicenter, its lands consumed by the insidious Murk—a rolling sea of malevolent black fog that devoured all in its path. The once-thriving nation became a desolate wasteland, with its people either perishing instantaneously or vanishing without a trace beneath the suffocating veil of the Murk. Only the expatriate Dorians managed to escape the grim fate, seeking refuge in the other nearby lands. Among these lands, Kemmet became the destination for the largest contingent of exiled Dorians, resulting in a complex social dynamic—a fragile caste system that grapples with the integration of Dorians and the indigenous population.

Today, the remnants of Doria stand as a haunting testament to the ravages of The Black Day and the enduring impact of the Murk. Varranthal, the capital city that once symbolized the might of the Vardan Empire, now lies silent and lifeless—a ghostly reminder of the nation's former grandeur. The scattered survivors of Doria's fall carry with them the weight of a shattered legacy and the indomitable spirit to rebuild amidst the shadows.

#### Dorians at a Glance

![A Dorian Family in Exile](https://gyazo.com/48f1b2166d01eb172d28a9b7aea032fd)

**Noble Houses and Ancestral Lineage:**

Within the remnants of the Vardan Empire, the noble houses hold a prominent position in society, serving as the bedrock of political influence and social standing. Many individuals in the Near Lands take great pride in tracing their ancestry back to the Vardan Empire, as it signifies a connection to a glorious past and the fabled bloodlines of the imperial rulers.

The noble houses, often referred to as the "Houses of Legacy," are custodians of traditions, heritage, and the remnants of Vardan culture. They meticulously maintain extensive genealogical records, carefully documenting the lineage of their families, and proudly displaying their prestigious heritage. These ancestral connections are seen as a source of honor and legitimacy, granting the nobility a sense of entitlement and authority.

**Extensive Guild Systems:**

In the fabric of Doria's society, an intricate and elaborate guild system thrives, woven into the very essence of everyday life. These guilds are associations of skilled artisans, merchants, and professionals who come together to protect their trade secrets, uphold quality standards, and secure economic prosperity. Each guild operates as a self-governing body, setting its own regulations and hierarchies.

The guilds of Doria represent a diverse range of crafts and vocations, including the esteemed Guild of Arcanists, Guild of Blacksmiths, Guild of Traders, Guild of Scribes, and many others. Membership in these guilds is highly esteemed, offering individuals not only the opportunity for professional growth but also social recognition and access to exclusive networks.

**Honorable Duels and Matriarchal Families:**

Deeply ingrained in the cultural norms of Doria is the practice of honorable dueling. The concept of personal honor is paramount in this society, and conflicts or disputes between individuals are often resolved through ritualistic combat. These duels serve as a means to settle grievances, restore honor, and determine the rightful victor.

Another distinctive aspect of Dorian culture is the prevalence of matriarchal families. Women hold significant influence within these families, assuming the role of decision-makers and arrangers of marriages. Matrons, known as "Matriarchs," play a central role in selecting suitable matches for their children, considering factors such as social standing, compatibility, and strategic alliances. This matriarchal system reflects a balance of power and authority between genders and fosters a strong sense of familial unity and lineage preservation.

**Retaining Cultural Identity as a Nation in Refuge:**

The expatriate population of Dorians, forced to leave their homeland in the wake of The Black Day, has been resolute in preserving their cultural identity as a nation in refuge. Despite their scattered settlements and integration into foreign lands, they steadfastly cling to their customs, traditions, and language, carrying the flame of Dorian heritage wherever they go.

Dorian expatriates form tight-knit communities, creating social enclaves that serve as bastions of their cultural identity. These communities strive to maintain distinct customs, celebrate traditional festivals, and uphold the teachings of their ancestors. Language schools, cultural centers, and communal gatherings become focal points for preserving the Dorian way of life, ensuring that future generations remain connected to their roots.

This tenacious focus on cultural identity is not only a means of preserving the past but also a testament to the unyielding spirit of the Dorians. It serves as a reminder that, despite the shattered remnants of their once-mighty empire, the essence of Doria endures in the hearts and minds of its people, forging an unbreakable bond that transcends time and adversity.

### Caranth: The Chaos of Freedom

![The Caranthian Cityscape](https://gyazo.com/c1c4ffbb87d8ac6a5dc425062c0e0f46)

The land of Carantia, situated at the farthest reaches of the Vardan Empire, has always maintained its distinct culture and unwavering commitment to martial traditions. Its people, known for their warlike nature, hold military prowess and disciplined organization in high regard, prioritizing them above civil liberties. Even their artistic expressions bear the mark of their militant spirit, with towering spires adorned with vivid depictions of drills and triumphant victories.

Following the collapse of the empire, Carantia emerged as a formidable rival to Doria, sparking centuries of intense competition and warfare between the two powers. Their primary battleground became the Dorian vassal of Ruthenia, where their shared border became a constant backdrop of conflict, stained with bloodshed and the clash of steel.

Had it not been for The Black Day, Carantia may have achieved its ambition of conquering Doria and resurrecting the Imperium. However, the fateful battle of Doria witnessed the demise of the entire royal house of Carantia, with the exception of one sole survivor—Rorn, a distant nephew who inherited the weight of the fallen dynasty. Tragically, even his life was abruptly cut short by an assassin's hand, abruptly ending the VarZolen line.

Seizing the opportunity presented by this upheaval, activists and visionaries within Carantia drove the former kingdom toward a new era as a democracy. Over the past three decades, their efforts have borne fruit, resulting in the establishment of a democratic system. However, the transition has not been without challenges. Political factions now vie for influence and power, while the loss of their expert military force has left Carantia in a precarious and vulnerable position, susceptible to external threats.

#### Caranthians at a Glance

![Caranthian Workshop with Apprentices](https://gyazo.com/6db873b132ee7721773013f0752bda70)

**By the Sea, by the Air:**

Carantia, situated on a rugged archipelago with towering mountains and breathtaking vistas, boasts a geography as diverse as its cultural heritage. Surrounded by vast seas, the Carantians have long been skilled navigators, mastering both conventional sea vessels and majestic airships that soar through the skies. Their maritime traditions are deeply ingrained in their way of life, and the sight of their ships dotting the horizon is a testament to their prowess.

**A Land of Lands:**

In the wake of the empire's collapse, Carantia experienced a significant transformation, evolving into a confederation of democratic city-states. Each city-state operates autonomously, with its own government, laws, and distinct character. While this confederation system ensures local autonomy, it also fosters a spirit of competition and occasional rivalry between the city-states. Yet, when faced with external threats or challenges, the Carantians have historically shown a remarkable ability to unite and defend their collective interests.

**Legendary Hosts:**

One of the hallmarks of Carantian culture is their legendary hospitality. The Carantians are renowned for their graciousness and warm welcome extended to visitors and guests. It is said that no one leaves Carantia without experiencing their generosity, feasting on sumptuous meals, and enjoying the finest entertainment. This tradition of hospitality is deeply rooted in their society and reflects their values of communal harmony and mutual respect.

**The Great Forge:**

Nestled at the base of a dormant volcano, Carantia is home to magnificent forgeworks that have been honed to perfection over generations. The intense heat and abundant mineral resources provided by the volcanic region have allowed the Carantians to excel in the art of metallurgy and craftsmanship. Skilled blacksmiths and artisans create exquisite weapons, armor, and ornamental pieces that are highly sought after throughout the continent. The glowing furnaces and rhythmic hammering of the forgeworks serve as a testament to Carantia's dedication to the mastery of their craft.
In the face of shifting fortunes and changing political landscapes, Carantia stands as a resilient land, holding onto its militant traditions, maritime legacy, democratic city-states, legendary hospitality, and the resounding clang of hammers shaping metal at the foot of a majestic volcano.

### Ruthenia: The Edge of Oblivion

![Novemgrod, the City of Mist](https://gyazo.com/f144e6d3442d94923fdb2d92452855fb)

Ruthenia was the second land to succumb to Varden's might and an initial partner in the formation of the Empire, boasts a multitude of vibrant and cosmopolitan cities among the Near Lands. Situated between the eastern reaches of Doria and the western expanse of Carantia, Ruthenia has long been a hotly contested region, witnessing centuries of conflict and ever-changing loyalties.

During the War, Ruthenia adeptly played both sides, skillfully maneuvering for increased power and influence. The collective cities of Ruthenia, recognizing their strategic value, sold their mercenary forces to the highest bidder, ensuring that their ancient conquerors remained weakened and incapable of launching successful campaigns against them.

However, the devastating The Black Day and the encroaching Murk took a severe toll on the eastern third of Ruthenia. The region was left in ruins, and many of the once-mighty political dynasties crumbled within a mere five years. Those who survived were thrust into a desperate struggle for stability, as they grappled with the aftermath of the catastrophe. The resilient and fiercely individualistic Ruthen people, known for their resourcefulness, brace themselves for a new era, ever watchful of the potential resurgence of their rival, Carantania.

In the midst of this tumultuous landscape, the metropolitan cities of Ruthenia continue to shine as beacons of culture and progress, their streets teeming with diversity and intellectual pursuits. Amidst the echoes of past battles and the looming threat of a resurgent Carantania, Ruthenia stands as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of its people.

#### Ruthenians at a Glance

![Ruthenian soldiers waiting at the train station](https://gyazo.com/2a737948bffd95d3d69c967010eb4535)

**The Ancient and the New:**


Within the borders of Ruthenia, a land steeped in history and diverse influences, one finds a mesmerizing sight: the striking spired architecture that adorns its cities. Many of these architectural marvels pay homage to the original designs of the Vardan Empire, serving as a reminder of the region's glorious past. These towering structures stand as testaments to the architectural prowess and artistic ingenuity of the Ruthen people.

However, despite the grandeur of their cities, Ruthenia is not without its cultural divisions. A distinct gap exists between the rural peasantry, who toil under the vast expanse of the countryside, and the bustling industrial centers that dominate the urban landscapes. The cities are filled with factories, where the noise of machinery reverberates through the streets, creating a stark contrast to the serenity of the rural fields. This divide in lifestyles and aspirations often fuels tensions and a sense of disconnect between the two worlds.

**Serfs and Kings:**

Ruthenia's political structure is characterized by a system where the nobles, known as Korovladi, hold direct ownership of their lands under the rule of the Korvus - King. This hierarchical arrangement shapes the power dynamics within the realm, with the nobles exerting influence and control over their respective territories. The Korvus acts as the central authority, responsible for maintaining order and overseeing the affairs of the kingdom. This delicate balance of power between the monarchy and the noble class often plays a pivotal role in shaping the course of Ruthenia's history.

**The Grey Muses:**

At the heart of Ruthen culture lies the spirit of resilience and endurance. The people are stern and resolute, weathering the trials and tribulations that life throws their way. It is through this perseverance that the Ruthen people produce great works of writing, capturing the essence of their experiences and the soul of their nation. Some notable authors within the Ruthen literary tradition include:

-Ivana Morozova - Renowned for her introspective and evocative poetry collection, "Whispers of the Frozen Land."
-Aleksander Petrovich - A master of historical fiction, his epic novel "The Chronicles of Rus" chronicles the turbulent events of Ruthen history.
-Natalya Dragunova - Known for her thought-provoking literary essays and insightful social commentary in her book "Reflections of the Silent Steppes."

These authors, among many others, contribute to the rich tapestry of Ruthen literature, capturing the spirit, resilience, and deep-rooted traditions of the Ruthen people. Their works serve as a testament to the enduring cultural legacy that continues to shape the literary landscape of Ruthenia.

### Pytaris

![The Ancient Ruins of Pyta, the old capital](https://gyazo.com/f47a36056712bb04949f03f41c6cf2c6)

Nestled across the towering peaks of the Mavren mountains, Pytharis stands as the cultural nucleus of the Near Lands. With an air of exoticism and a penchant for philosophical pursuits, Pytharis has long been revered as the wellspring of art, culture, and intellectual exploration. While it has never sought dominance, Pytharis has consistently played a vital role as the agricultural powerhouse of Tellus throughout recorded history.

Situated between the ever-rivaling powers of Doria and Turcia, Pytharis has been a coveted economic hub and a hotly contested territory for countless generations. Even during the tumultuous years of the War, Pytharis's attempts at maintaining neutrality proved futile, as armies marched across its lands, planting flags only to be displaced by the opposing forces soon after.

The Black Day, with its devastating effects, spared much of Pytharis from its direct wrath. This fortunate circumstance granted Pytharis a significant advantage in warding off the encroachments of Turcia, resulting in a fragile balance that has held precariously for the past three decades.

#### Pytarks at a Glance

![A family in the Pytar countryside](https://cdn.midjourney.com/05195016-a4d4-467e-81dd-5c32c832e69f/0_1.png)

**The silence of Le Vides:**

Pytharis is home to the ancient and revered temples of Le Vides, which were once vibrant centers of spiritual devotion. However, in the wake of The Black Day, these temples have fallen into a mysterious silence, their sacred rites and rituals abandoned. The profound stillness that envelops these sacred sites now hints at a forgotten legacy.

**The Network:**

Renowned for their astute intelligence operations, Pytharis boasts the finest network of spies in all of Tellus. These clandestine operatives, shrouded in secrecy, gather intelligence and disseminate information with unparalleled precision. Whispers of Pytharian spies weaving their web of intrigue echo throughout the realms, their allegiances and motives remaining enigmatic to most.

**The Golden Princes:**

Ruling over Pytharis are a series of merchant princes, each vying for supremacy through the art of economics. These shrewd and cunning individuals manipulate markets, amass wealth, and wield their influence to shape the destiny of Pytharis. The city-state becomes a labyrinthine arena of economic rivalries and power struggles, where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye.

**Songs of Legend:**

The people of Pytharis are renowned for their exceptional skills in dance and entertainment. Gifted with a natural flair for captivating performances, they captivate audiences with their grace, fluidity, and unparalleled artistry. Pytharian dancers and entertainers are highly sought after in noble courts across Tellus, their mesmerizing displays of talent adding a touch of elegance and splendor to grand festivities and celebrations."


### The Lands Beyond the Empire

#### Turcia: The Land of Living Gods

![The Bright City of Sahr sees no Conflict with the Old and New](https://cdn.midjourney.com/b51d3ab4-c1c0-49f1-a150-2e21bb94e51f/0_3_384_N.webp) 

A land steeped in history, Turcia has seen various forms of governance throughout its existence. From being ruled by nomadic steppe warriors to an empire with a complex social structure, it has evolved over time. In the past five centuries, Turcia has embraced a theocratic system, with a singular figure known as the Golden Lord holding dominion over the land.

The enigmatic presence of the Golden Lord first emerges in written records around the early 470s BBD. Unlike rulers with spouses or successors, the Golden Lord has defied mortality, remaining a solitary figure with no apparent heirs. Revered as a descendant or embodiment of the divine entity Makru, the Golden Lord has ushered in a golden age for Turcia, coinciding with the decline and disappearance of the Vardan Empire. The favor of the gods seems to have bestowed its blessings upon the land of the Turci.

However, unsettling rumors have started to circulate within the court, casting doubt on the fate of the Golden Lord. For over six decades, no written accounts of the Lord have been recorded, fueling speculation that he may be deceased or absent. Despite this uncertainty, Turcia has managed to maintain internal order and even expand its borders during this time. The implications of the Lord's absence or demise remain uncertain, and Pytharis, in the neighboring Far Lands, watches with a sense of cautious optimism, grateful for the respite from potential turmoil. The fate of Turcia hangs in the balance, awaiting the revelation of the truth and the subsequent course of events.

![Turcik families often work within the state together](https://cdn.midjourney.com/106ec9a9-f589-4606-8f72-2532728a5161/0_2.png)

One of the remarkable phenomena in Turcicus is the occurrence of children born with mesmerizing purple eyes. These rare individuals are believed to be blessed by Makru, the deity associated with the Golden Lord. Recognized as a sign of divine favor, these children are sought out by the servants of the Golden Lord, who take them under their wing for special training and tutelage.

Slavery, although legal in Turcicus, carries certain unique aspects that distinguish it from common practices elsewhere. While slaves exist within the society, they possess certain rights that allow them to purchase their own freedom. The ability to buy one's freedom is a recognized path for slaves to regain their autonomy and become free citizens. However, it is important to note that slavery is not hereditary, and the children of slaves do not inherit their parents' enslaved status. Nevertheless, familial debt can lead to the enslavement of a family, emphasizing the interconnectedness of economic and social factors in Turcicus.

In the complex tapestry of beliefs within Turcicus, there exists a cult devoted to the worship of the enigmatic Midnight Lady, regarded by its followers as the counterpart or companion of the Golden Lord. Members of this clandestine group engage in secretive practices, including assassinations and impersonations of officials to manipulate the country's affairs according to their beliefs. The influence exerted by the cult adds a layer of intrigue and unpredictability to the already intricate power dynamics within Turcicus.

Beyond its religious and political intricacies, the Turci people themselves exhibit a distinct and endearing trait of openness and curiosity about the wider world. They eagerly welcome travelers and storytellers, valuing the exchange of knowledge and experiences. The Turci people's genuine interest prompts them to offer hospitality and often compensate individuals for sharing tales and information, further fostering a culture of dialogue and storytelling within their society.

#### Suomi

![A Suomi villiage is often only lived in every 4-6 months of the year](https://cdn.midjourney.com/b6870f28-fc7d-4a3b-8a1b-1d952ef41ad9/0_0_384_N.webp)


Deep in the northern reaches of Tellus, where the rugged mountains embrace the eternal snow, resides the resilient and proud Suomi people. Their ancestral roots run deep, and their migratory patterns span the vast taiga, moving from north to south with the changing seasons. Embodying a spirit of freedom and strength, the Suomi have cultivated a warrior culture that permeates every aspect of their lives.

Guided by the Tursakkaanen of Vuorus, their venerable shamans perform sacred rituals, offering bountiful sacrifices of food, goods, and life to the divine forces they revere. Among the Suomi, it is customary for the second-born children to embark on journeys to the south, their inheritance structure intricately linked to the eldest siblings. These brave Suomaran individuals often find themselves serving as elite mercenaries, celebrated in countless bardic tales for their towering stature and unwavering courage.

The Suomi people are organized into eighteen tribes, each led by a Joht (Lord) and Noaidi (Shaman). Together, these thirty-six individuals form the esteemed Althing, a governing body responsible for establishing laws and resolving disputes between the tribes. Within their ranks, the Vuorenuja hold a special status, bestowed upon elder Noaidi who have communed with the gods themselves. Recognized as wise visionaries, they possess the privilege to cast tie-breaking votes during Althing gatherings, ensuring the resolution of important matters.

The Suomi's indomitable spirit, steadfast traditions, and sacred rituals rooted in nature have shaped them into a resilient and honorable people. Their unwavering curiosity and openness to the world have made them eager listeners and passionate conversationalists, often valuing knowledge and information enough to offer generous rewards or extend warm hospitality in exchange for engaging conversations.

![Fishing if often one of best ways to attain food in these cold lands](https://cdn.midjourney.com/7af2537b-7725-4f83-b09c-bff62634f073/0_0_384_N.webp)

Nestled amidst the majestic peaks of Aventhorn, the sacred mountains where the Tursakkaanen reside, lies a pivotal rite of passage for all leaders and heroes of the Suomi people. Aspiring individuals must embark on a treacherous climb, ascending to the heights where the frozen air bites and the gods' presence is palpable. It is here, amidst the icy winds and unforgiving terrain, that visions of the divine may be granted. Those who survive this perilous journey often emerge forever changed, claiming to hear the whispers of their gods directly, a lifelong connection forged in the solitude of the mountain peaks.

Within Suomi society, both men and women share a dedication to physical prowess and endurance. Annually, as the world awakens from the winter's grasp, the Suomi gather for vibrant spring games. These spirited competitions become a testament to their strength and skill, with participants undertaking extraordinary feats to showcase their might. These contests serve not only as demonstrations of physical prowess but also as a celebration of communal unity and shared determination.

The revered Shamans of the Suomi hold a position of great influence and spiritual guidance within the community. Often acting as conduits between the mortal realm and the divine, these wise practitioners may send specific children on extraordinary voyages as commanded by their gods. Endowed with a sacred purpose, these young adventurers embark on journeys of self-discovery, often encountering great trials and revelations. Upon their return, they are met with honor and respect, taking their rightful place as esteemed members of their tribe, entrusted with preserving ancestral wisdom and traditions.

Deeply rooted in a communal ethos, the Suomi extend their hospitality to strangers, offering them shelter and sustenance as a matter of cultural practice. The spirit of brotherhood and unity permeates their gatherings, where great feasts are shared, stories are woven, and bonds are forged. However, it is crucial to note that the Suomi possess a formidable sense of justice, and when wronged, their peaceful demeanor can transform into swift and resolute action, unleashing their innate capacity for violence in defense of what they hold dear.

The Suomi people, marked by their sacred mountain rituals, physical prowess, and deep communal ties, embody a profound connection with their gods and the natural world around them. Their unwavering hospitality is an extension of their belief in the interconnectedness of all beings, fostering an atmosphere of camaraderie and shared experiences that have shaped the Suomi into a resilient and noble society.

#### Kemet


Nestled amidst the enigmatic lands of the Black River, Kemet stands as a testament to the ancient heritage that predates the memories of most. Monuments and structures, hallowed by time, bear witness to a glorious past that has influenced and inspired countless empires and kingdoms throughout the ages.

However, the grandeur of bygone eras has slowly waned, and Kemet has experienced a prolonged decline. Once a global powerhouse, it gradually receded into a regional dominion, ultimately becoming an isolated kingdom along the banks of the Black River. A succession of inept and mediocre rulers contributed to this downward trajectory, leading to courtly isolation and a reluctance to embrace technological advancements. These factors left Kemet vulnerable to external influences, casting a shadow over its former glory.

The opportunistic Dorians seized this moment of vulnerability, employing military campaigns and occupying Kemet to establish their control over the court and civil systems. Despite their dominance, they dared not depose the revered Pharaohs, whose sacred status and cultural influence held immense sway over the people. Thus, a delicate balance emerged, with the Dorians reigning over Kemet while cautiously avoiding a mass rebellion.

However, with the fall of Doria, a home to call upon in times of need no longer existed for the people of Kemet. In this critical juncture, a young and ambitious Pharaoh named Shafra-Ab has taken it upon himself to rally his forces and expel the Dorians from their ancestral lands. Sensing the impending threat, the Dorians have tightened their grip, strategically funneling expatriate groups from Doria into the kingdom, in a bid to perpetuate their dominance and preserve their hold on power.

Kemet, once the cradle of ancient wisdom and profound civilization, now finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with the shadows of its past and the uncertainties of its future. The fate of the kingdom hangs in the balance as the Pharaoh Shafra-Ab embarks on a daring quest to reclaim Kemet's sovereignty, while the Dorians endeavor to consolidate their control over a land that teeters on the precipice of change. The echoes of an ancient civilization resound within Kemet, and the unfolding chapters of its history will determine whether it shall rise from the ashes of decline or succumb to the tides of fate.

Within the borders of Kemet, a land steeped in ancient mystique, a brutal apartheid state has taken root, forged by the Dorians' iron fist. The subjugated Kemet populace, who dare to challenge their oppressors, face the dire consequences of death or enslavement. The pervasive system of discrimination casts a dark shadow over the kingdom, perpetuating a cycle of fear and oppression.

Deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of the Kemet people is their reverence for the Black River, which they perceive as the lifeblood of the earth itself. The river's flowing waters hold immense spiritual significance, symbolizing the eternal connection between the land, its people, and the divine forces that govern their existence. The Black River weaves through their myths, rituals, and daily lives, serving as a source of inspiration and awe.

Scattered across the vast expanse of Kemet are ancient temples, remnants of a time preceding the rise of other kingdoms. These sacred structures, shrouded in enigma and laced with curses, stand as testaments to a forgotten era. These sites of worship, abandoned by gods and haunted by the spirits of bygone civilizations, serve as a stark reminder of the profound mysteries and deep history that permeate the land.

In spite of their own hardships and destitution, the people of Kemet embody a spirit of generosity and hospitality. Rooted in customs that span thousands of years, they offer what little they possess to those in need, embodying the enduring principles of their ancient culture. However, this noble virtue can occasionally lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, as certain habits or remarks may inadvertently offend their sensibilities, causing tensions to arise.

Within the tapestry of Kemet's existence, a complex interplay of suffering, resilience, and ancient customs unfolds. The apartheid state inflicted by the Dorians casts a shadow over the land, while the people draw strength from their reverence for the Black River and navigate the remnants of long-forgotten temples. The spirit of generosity, despite the hardships faced, remains a guiding principle, even as cultural sensitivities and ancient customs shape the interactions and dynamics within Kemet. The destiny of this ancient kingdom, with its deep-rooted traditions and turbulent history, hangs in the balance as the struggle for liberation and cultural preservation continues to unfold.

#### Beithar

In the distant northeast reaches of Tellus, sprawling across vast flat plains, the proud Yoruba people make their home. Guided by the ebb and flow of their nomadic lifestyle, they traverse the open grasslands with their majestic herds of horses, seeking fertile pastures and new horizons. The Yoruba suB Continent extends its influence to the neighboring lands that border the remnants of old Doria and the resolute Suomi. These lands have witnessed the Yoruba's alternating fortunes, as rival powers seize the opportunities when the Yoruba are divided and suffer the consequences when they reunite under a formidable Tarkhan.

This age-old cycle of dominance and unity has persisted for thousands of years. A Tarkhan emerges, leading the Yoruba tribes to conquest and territorial expansion, while the border towns serve as living testament to the cyclical nature of Yoruban dominance. Their customs, traits, and even language blend seamlessly with Yoruba culture. The swift act of kneeling in reverence and submission to a newly proclaimed Tarkhan carries profound meaning, symbolizing the acknowledgment of an unstoppable force that will lay waste to all obstacles in its path.

For centuries, the empire played a delicate game of manipulation and appeasement with the Yoruba hordes, seeking to avoid direct conflict and instead offering incentives to maintain a semblance of stability. However, with the dissolution of the empire and the rise of the charismatic Yoruban prince, Bataar, the tides of fate have cast an unseen die. The fate of the Yoruba and their role in shaping the future of Tellusnow hangs in the balance. Should Bataar successfully rally the fragmented tribes and unite their collective strength, the Yoruba will emerge as the most formidable force in the realm, potentially heralding a new era of Yoruban ascendancy and reshaping the political landscape of Tellus.

Deep within the cultural tapestry of the Yoruba people, a profound tradition known as "memory songs" weaves the threads of their collective memory. Through the magical power of singing, the Yoruba possess the ability to transfer memories and wisdom across generations. Elder members of the community utilize their melodic voices to imbue their stories, experiences, and knowledge into the minds of the younger ones. This ancient practice serves as a bridge connecting the past with the present, preserving the ancestral heritage and ensuring that the lessons of their forebears are carried forward.

From a tender age, the Yoruba children are initiated into the art of horsemanship and the intricacies of working from the backs of their majestic Steppe Rams. These imposing creatures, adorned with magnificent horns, hold a place of utmost significance in Yoruba culture. They provide not only transportation and labor but also a deep spiritual connection between the Yoruba and the land they traverse. The symbiotic relationship between the Yoruba and their Steppe Rams is nurtured through a bond built on trust, respect, and mutual reliance.

In the realm of warfare and hunting, the Yoruba display their prowess with the atlatl—a hooked implement utilized to propel javelins across vast distances, sometimes exceeding hundreds of yards. This ancient projectile weapon, honed to perfection by generations of Yoruban warriors, serves as a testament to their precision and skill. While the Yoruba have embraced firearms in their interactions with outsiders, their traditional weapons, including the atlatl, remain the preferred choice when engaging in battles or pursuing their traditional way of life.

Integrity and honesty are held in the highest regard among the Yoruba, for their legends recount the dire consequences awaiting those who engage in deception. Their moral compass is rooted in a profound belief in justice and the afterlife, where deceptive souls are destined to face terrible punishments. This cultural ethos of unflinching honesty permeates the fabric of Yoruban society, shaping their interactions and engendering trust and transparency among their people.

The Yoruba, with their time-honored memory songs, mastery of horsemanship, prowess in ancient weaponry, and unwavering commitment to truth, stand as a formidable force, both revered and respected within the realm of Tellus. Their rich cultural heritage and unyielding principles continue to guide them, as they navigate the ever-shifting tides of history and strive to shape their own destiny in the vast expanse of the world.

## The Great War and the Black Day

The Great War erupted with a cataclysmic clash between the formidable nations of Doria and Carantia. Tensions between the two had simmered for years, fueled by territorial disputes, political maneuvering, and a deep-rooted sense of national pride. The spark that ignited the powder keg came in the form of an assassination, an act that would forever alter the course of history.

As the war unfolded, Ruthenia and Hellas found themselves on the sidelines, initially maintaining a stance of neutrality. Ruthenia, a nation known for its fertile lands and agricultural prowess, sought to shield its resources from the ravages of war. Hellas, embroiled in its own bitter conflict with the expansionist nation of Turcicus, had its attention divided, grappling with the pressures of defending its borders and preserving its sovereignty.

The cunning strategists of Doria recognized an opportunity to tip the scales in their favor. By declaring war on Turcicus, they enticed Hellas into joining their cause. Hellas, burdened by the ongoing hostilities with Turcicus and enticed by the promises of favorable post-war agreements, reluctantly acquiesced to Doria's call for aid. The once-neutral Hellas was thrust into the maelstrom of war, its fate irrevocably intertwined with that of Doria.

Carantia, its princes driven by its thirst for dominion, sought to expand its influence and reshape the geopolitical landscape. Recognizing the vulnerability of Ruthenia, Carantia employed coercive tactics to force its involvement in the war. They threatened to sever the vital trade routes that sustained Ruthenia's food stores, unleashing the specter of famine upon the nation. Ruthenia, faced with the dire choice between submission or starvation, reluctantly succumbed to Carantia's demands, becoming embroiled in the conflict against its will.

Years of ruinous warfare ensued, marked by a relentless cycle of destruction and despair. Both Doria and Carantia, fueled by their belief in their own righteousness and the desire to dominate their adversaries, unleashed the full force of their military and technological might. It was during this time that the concept of Esoteria emerged as a potent weapon.

Esoteria, the fusion of industrial innovation and arcane magic, represented a revolutionary advancement in the art of war. Scholars, engineers, and magicians collaborated to develop a new breed of devastating weaponry. Enchanted artillery shells obliterated entire battalions, armored constructs bolstered the frontlines, and protective barriers defied conventional assault. The harnessing of magic in conjunction with industrial machinery brought forth unprecedented levels of destruction and loss.

However, amidst the grim stalemate and the horrors of trench warfare, a breakthrough came in the form of airborne warfare. Airships, colossal vessels propelled by enchanted engines and armed with potent weaponry, soared above the desolate battlefields. These floating behemoths defied the constraints of the land and provided a means to bypass the entrenched defenses.

The introduction of airships heralded a new era of warfare. Rapid advancements in aerial technology allowed for strategic bombardments, swift troop deployments, and unprecedented mobility. The war-torn skies became a theater of high-stakes battles, with daring pilots and crews engaged in deadly dogfights, dropping devastating payloads upon enemy positions.

The culmination of these advancements and strategic maneuvers led to the fateful Siege of Varranthal, a pivotal event that would forever change the course of the war. The city of Varranthal, a symbol of power and strategic importance, became the focal point of a relentless assault. Both sides poured vast resources and unleashed the full potential of Esoteria in a desperate bid to secure victory.

It was on "The Black Day," the climax of the siege, that an unimaginable catastrophe occurred. Something went awry, shrouding the city of Varranthal in a malevolent force known as the Murk. The Murk manifested as an otherworldly phenomenon, devouring everything in its path and leaving only desolation in its wake. The city, its inhabitants, and the armies locked in combat were consumed by this enigmatic darkness.

The Murk, an ever-expanding abyss devoid of life, proved inscrutable and implacable. Despite extensive investigations and attempts to discern its nature, no bones, remains, or tangible evidence of the vanished souls were ever recovered. The Murk became an enduring enigma, a haunting reminder of the unspeakable tragedy that unfolded on that ominous day.

In the aftermath of the cataclysm, the shattered nations were left reeling, their populations decimated, and their once-proud cities reduced to mere ruins. The Black Day marked the definitive end of the Great War, not through a decisive victory, but through the collective realization of the irreparable devastation wrought upon Tellus. Leaders, generals, and soldiers perished in the Murk, their ambitions and dreams forever extinguished.

The world emerged from the crucible of war forever scarred, its nations forever changed. The Great War and the Black Day became indelible chapters in history, serving as a somber reminder of the catastrophic consequences of unchecked conflict, the dangers of escalating technology, and the relentless pursuit of power. The scars of the past would shape the future, as the survivors grappled with the challenges of reconstruction, healing, and the ever-present specter of the Murk that loomed as a reminder of the price paid for their hubris.

- Destruction holds an inherent beauty, an exquisite form of expression.

**Holy Days

- The period between The Red Day and Herald's Day is known as Brenndauer, a time when the followers of the Charred One are called to be most active, stoking the flames of their mad pursuit.

No grand temples stand in honor of the Charred One, nor do intentional monuments proclaim their existence. Their monuments are the scorched remnants of cities, and their temples lie within the ruins left by others. In the aftermath of the Great War, those who survived faced a choice: to rebuild or to revel in the ashes of what once stood.
The birth of the Charred One came from the desolation of Gavo, a city ravaged by a cataclysmic firestorm in the year 3 BBD. It emerged silently, calling out to those filled with grief, trauma, and madness.
Followers of the Charred One encounter no tolerance for their beliefs within established cities or towns. Instead, they gather in abandoned places, congregating in the shadows before spreading to the farthest reaches of Tellus to fulfill the will of their deranged deity.
The Charred believe in the ultimate unmaking of all creation, and they employ any means necessary to bring about its destruction. Through manipulation, intrigue, assassination, and incitement of unrest, they seek to ignite the world in chaos. They take particular pleasure in obliterating ancient structures and monuments, for in their destruction, not only the present is ruined but also all potential futures are erased.

#### The Burning Congregation

Followers of the Charred One operate in a clandestine and covert manner, reminiscent of terroristic cells or cults. They are driven by their dark devotion to destruction, chaos, and the ultimate annihilation of all creation. Their actions are marked by ruthlessness, secrecy, and a willingness to employ any means necessary to further their cause.
Acting as agents of terror, the followers of the Charred One execute acts of violence, sabotage, and manipulation to sow fear and chaos within society. They target symbols of stability, authority, and ancient structures, relishing in the destruction that erases not only the present but also all potential futures. Their acts range from arson and assassination to incitement of unrest and manipulation of power dynamics.
Recruitment of new members is a delicate and secretive process. The followers of the Charred One seek out individuals who exhibit signs of grief, trauma, and madness, drawing them towards the allure of the destructive deity. They identify those disillusioned with the established order, seeking purpose and an outlet for their deep-seated pain. Through subtle manipulation, the followers gradually expose these individuals to the ideologies and rituals of the Charred One, enticing them with promises of power, release from fear, and the ecstasy of destruction.
Recruitment efforts primarily occur in abandoned places and hidden gatherings, away from the prying eyes of society. Potential recruits are approached individually, tested for their resilience, and gradually introduced to the twisted beliefs and practices of the cult. The followers of the Charred One exploit their vulnerabilities, amplifying their fears and anguishes, ultimately offering them a sense of purpose and belonging within the cult's dark embrace.
The recruitment process involves indoctrination through rituals, rites, and teachings that reinforce the notions of destruction, chaos, and the beauty found in annihilation. New members are gradually initiated into the cult's inner circle, where they are assigned mentors to guide them in the dark arts, imparting knowledge of fire manipulation, subterfuge, and the secrets of the Charred One's doctrines.
Trust and loyalty are paramount among the followers, as betrayal is met with severe consequences. The cult operates with strict secrecy, ensuring that their activities remain hidden from the eyes of authority. Members communicate through encrypted channels and secret symbols, using coded language to avoid detection. This secretive nature ensures that the followers remain elusive, striking fear into the hearts of those who would stand against them.

##### Sins and Penances

Transgressions
Betrayal of Secrets: Revealing the hidden rituals, doctrines, or identities of fellow cult members or the inner workings of the Charred One's operations to outsiders is considered a grave transgression. It undermines the cult's secrecy and puts its members at risk.
Failure to Execute Destructive Acts: Followers of the Charred One are expected to actively contribute to the cause of destruction and chaos. Failing to carry out assigned acts of violence, sabotage, or manipulation is seen as a betrayal of their commitment to the deity and his teachings.
Sympathy for Preservation: Showing empathy or compassion towards the preservation of life, stability, or ancient structures contradicts the fundamental beliefs of the cult. Any expression of sentiment or reluctance towards embracing the annihilation and eradication advocated by the Charred One is seen as a serious transgression.
Disobedience to Superiors: Defying the commands or orders given by higher-ranking members within the cult hierarchy is considered a transgression. The followers of the Charred One operate with a strict chain of command, and any act of disobedience disrupts the unity and effectiveness of their destructive efforts.
Collaboration with Opposing Forces: Engaging in alliances, collaborations, or cooperations with individuals or groups that are actively opposing or obstructing the goals of the Charred One is seen as a betrayal. The cult expects absolute loyalty and allegiance to its cause, leaving no room for compromise or cooperation with those who stand against them.
Doubt or Questioning: Expressing doubt or questioning the teachings, ideologies, or actions of the Charred One is viewed as a transgression against the cult's core beliefs. Followers are expected to have unwavering faith and conviction in the path of destruction and chaos set forth by their deity.
Failure to Initiate New Recruits: Each member of the cult is entrusted with the task of recruiting and expanding their ranks. Failing to actively seek out and initiate new followers is considered a transgression. It hinders the growth and influence of the cult, impeding its ability to further the cause of destruction and spread chaos.
Revealing Personal Weaknesses: Sharing personal vulnerabilities or weaknesses with outsiders or fellow cult members is seen as a transgression against the cult's ethos. Followers are expected to present a unified front, projecting strength, and embracing the power that comes from the destruction they seek.
Atonement
Atonement for transgressions within the cult of the Charred One is a complex and arduous process, as the deity and his followers embrace destruction and chaos rather than traditional notions of repentance. However, there are some ways in which a follower can seek to regain favor and mitigate the consequences of their transgressions:
Offering Greater Destruction: One way to atone is to demonstrate an intensified commitment to the cause of destruction and chaos. The follower must engage in acts of unparalleled devastation, surpassing their previous actions and proving their dedication to the Charred One's principles. By causing widespread mayhem and furthering the cult's goals, they can strive to redeem themselves.
Sacrificial Rituals: Followers can partake in sacrificial rituals where they offer something significant to appease the Charred One and seek forgiveness. This might involve sacrificing a cherished possession, enduring physical pain, or even offering the lives of others to demonstrate their devotion and willingness to make amends.
Undertaking a Trial by Fire: A follower seeking atonement may undergo a trial by fire, a grueling test of their loyalty and commitment. This could involve enduring physical or psychological challenges, walking through flames, or subjecting themselves to extreme environments or situations associated with fire and destruction. Success in the trial signifies purification and potential forgiveness.
Completing a Mission of Destruction: The follower can be assigned a specific mission or task by the cult's leadership, designed to showcase their renewed dedication and loyalty. By successfully executing this mission, causing significant destruction or sowing chaos, they can demonstrate their remorse and willingness to make amends for their transgressions.
Reaffirming Allegiance through Rituals: Participating in intense and elaborate rituals can serve as acts of atonement. These rituals may involve self-flagellation, enduring pain or hardship, or engaging in acts symbolizing destruction and rebirth. Through these rituals, the follower reinforces their commitment to the Charred One and seeks purification from their past failures.
It's important to note that forgiveness within the cult of the Charred One is not easily granted. Atonement is a demanding and ongoing process that requires extreme dedication, unwavering loyalty, and a continuous pursuit of destruction. Even if a follower manages to atone for their transgressions, the memory of their past actions may linger, and they may always be viewed with caution and scrutiny by their fellow cult members.

### The Tursakkaanen

**Creeds**
The world is indifferent, neither cruel nor wonderful. It simply exists, as do we.

**Holy Days**
Red Sunsets: A sacred phenomenon for the Listeners, during which they may hear the whispers of their gods.

Long Twilight - December: In the Northern regions, this time of year is enveloped in near-constant darkness. It becomes an opportunity for the holy men to ascend the Mountain and attain new wisdom while their gods awaken.

Far to the North, the Tursakkaanen observe the world from their perch atop Mount Avrenthorn. They uphold an ancient system of laws and rituals passed down by the shamans and holy seers of the icy steppe.
While they do not actively interfere in the affairs of mankind, they exert influence upon those who are willing to listen to their timeless wisdom. Pilgrims who embark upon the arduous journey to the summit of the towering mountains may experience the resounding voices of the Nine echoing within their minds. The words are spoken slowly, spanning years to complete.
The followers of the Tursakkaanen, known as the Listeners, choose to surrender themselves to the currents of fate and the guidance of their own thoughts. They extend their consciousness beyond the present moment, immersing themselves in the ancient chants and sacred utterances of their deities. This communion allows them to become vessels of fate. A Listener often finds themselves in precisely the right place at the right time, although they may endure suffering as a consequence of their serendipity.
The Listeners are generally welcomed but met with some distrust among people from various corners of the world. Their tendency to also embody the roles of vagabonds, thieves, or humble individuals relegates them to the lower echelons of society within urban areas.

#### The Listeners

They perceive the world as an indifferent entity and believe in surrendering themselves to the currents of fate.

The Listeners lead a nomadic lifestyle, wandering through various lands and rarely gathering outside of Suomi Lands. They can often be seen working closely with tribal leaders in the northern regions, forging alliances and offering their unique insights. However, in other parts of the world, the Listeners may appear as vagabonds, blending into the lower echelons of society.
Recruitment of new members into the Tursakkaanen is an organic process driven by personal experiences and revelations. Potential recruits are often individuals who have shown a proclivity for seeking deeper truths and contemplating the workings of the world. They may encounter Listeners during their own journeys or chance encounters, where the Listeners share their timeless wisdom and insights. Those who resonate with the philosophy and beliefs of the Tursakkaanen may choose to join their ranks voluntarily.
The Listeners value introspection and self-discovery, encouraging new members to embark on personal quests and pilgrimages to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. They believe in the power of experience and direct revelation, as well as the resounding voices of the Nine that echo within the minds of the faithful. Listeners may guide and mentor new members, helping them navigate the complexities of their newfound spiritual path.
The Listeners prioritize the preservation of their ancient laws, rituals, and wisdom. They rely on oral traditions and sacred chants passed down through generations, keeping their beliefs alive through the recitation of ancient texts and the performance of rituals. Listeners engage in deep communion with their deities, seeking guidance and enlightenment from the voices that resonate within them.
Overall, the Listeners operate with a sense of humility, embracing their role as vessels of fate. They strive to live in harmony with the world and its natural rhythms, while offering their wisdom and guidance to those who are open to receiving it. The actions of the Listeners are guided by their unique understanding of the interconnectedness of fate, power, cold, life, and death, and their desire to navigate the currents of existence with grace and insight.

##### The 5 Ranks of Nine

Elder Seers are revered as the ultimate authorities and spiritual leaders among the Listeners.
Tribal Liaisons: These are Listeners who have earned the trust and respect of the tribal leaders in the northern regions where the Tursakkaanen frequently operate.

Seekers of Fate often bear distinctive ritualistic tattoos, each with a unique name symbolizing their personal quest or revelation. These tattoos serve as marks of distinction and recognition within the hierarchy.
It is worth noting that the hierarchy within the Tursakkaanen is fluid and flexible due to their wandering nature and decentralized structure. Authority and influence are often earned through wisdom, experience, and the respect garnered from both the Listeners themselves and the tribal communities with whom they interact. The ritualistic tattoos carried by the Seekers of Fate serve as visual indicators of their station and accomplishments within the hierarchy, symbolizing their spiritual growth and journey toward enlightenment.

##### Sins and Penances

Rejecting the Guidance of the Nine: The Nine voices that echo within the minds of the Listeners are considered a divine gift and a source of profound wisdom. A follower who intentionally ignores or rejects the guidance and insights offered by these voices goes against the core principles of the Tursakkaanen and commits a transgression.
Acting Against the Natural Order: The Tursakkaanen hold a deep reverence for the natural world and the interconnectedness of all beings.

Betraying the Trust of Fellow Listeners: The Listeners form a tight-knit community built on trust and shared experiences. A follower who intentionally betrays the trust of their fellow Listeners, engages in deceit, or reveals sacred knowledge to those outside the faith commits a serious transgression that undermines the unity and integrity of the Tursakkaanen.
Refusing Personal Growth and Self-Reflection: The Tursakkaanen emphasize personal introspection and the pursuit of self-discovery. A follower who stubbornly resists personal growth, fails to engage in self-reflection, or rejects opportunities for spiritual development and understanding commits a transgression against the principles of the Tursakkaanen.
Disrupting Sacred Ceremonies or Rituals: The Tursakkaanen hold their ceremonies and rituals as sacred and integral to their faith. A follower who intentionally disrupts or disrespects these ceremonies, whether through interruption, mockery, or inappropriate behavior, commits a transgression that dishonors the traditions and beliefs of the Tursakkaanen.
Failing to Uphold the Values of Serenity and Detachment: The Tursakkaanen believe in embracing the world with serenity and accepting the currents of fate. A follower who consistently acts with anger, aggression, or seeks personal gain at the expense of others violates the values of the Tursakkaanen and commits a transgression against the peaceful and detached nature they strive to embody.
It is important to note that the Tursakkaanen view transgressions as opportunities for growth and redemption. They believe in the power of self-reflection, repentance, and seeking forgiveness from the Nine and the community of Listeners. A follower who recognizes their transgressions, seeks atonement, and actively works towards rectifying their actions can find a path to redemption within the faith of the Tursakkaanen.

## Before We Start

Content Warning: [...]

Before you start, define lines that should not be crossed. Pause or rewind the game if something uncomfortable happens during a session. Always make sure everyone is comfortable with the direction of the story.

## Playing The Game

The Murk best operates like your favorite show or movie.  One person will take the role of the "Director" and the rest of the people shall play "Actors"

>
> Adventure Frames have been designed especially for Breathless games. Since no plot survives an encounter with the players, Adventure Frames focus on goals, scene descriptors, and complications. This leaves a lot of space for the GM to change the story on the fly, and just glue things back together when necessary.
